# Rotating cube using some basic algebra

Video inspiration: [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjWkNZ0SXfo)

## Explanation:

### Basic formula to translate/mimic 2d -> 3d
$$
x' = x/z \\
y' = y/z \\
$$
##
### To rotate the cube we will use some algebra
$$
x' = xcos\theta - ysin\theta\\
y' = xsin\theta + ycos\theta \\
$$
